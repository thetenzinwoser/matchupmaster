Based on the provided sources, here is a summary of the strategies and information for each unit in Mechabellum:

### Mechabellum Unit Strategies

Here is a detailed breakdown of each unit mentioned in the sources, including their uses, counters, how to play them, how to counter them, and their technologies.

#### Abyss

*   **Used against:** Melting Point
*   **Countered by:** (Coming soon)
*   **How to play Abyss:** Information on playing Abyss is listed as coming soon in the source.
*   **Mechabellum Abyss counter:** Information on countering Abyss is available.
*   **Abyss Builds:** Some highlighted Abyss builds are listed. Surrey's Abyss build is mentioned.
*   **Abyss Technologies:** Available technologies for Abyss, their viability, and how to use them are listed.

#### Arclight

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang, Mustang, Steel Ball, Sledgehammer, Fire Badger, Typhoon
*   **Countered by:** Marksman, Stormcaller, Rhino, Overlord, Fortress, Phoenix, Wraith, War Factory, Scorpion, Sabertooth
*   **How to play Arclight:** Arclights are very strong against crawlers throughout the game. They are good against fangs early but struggle once the fang shield is teched. It's recommended not to build Arclights against fangs, only versus crawlers. Arclights are very strong against crawlers. They can counter most medium units like Sledgehammers and Steel Balls with the Charged Shot technology. Pairing Arclights with Stormcallers is a good idea, as Stormcallers are effective against units that counter Arclights, such as fangs, Fortress, Scorpion, and Marksmen. If the enemy feeds your Arclights early with medium units and chaff, they can level quickly, potentially allowing for a carry Arclight strategy with the Elite Marksmen technology.
*   **Mechabellum Arclight counter:** If the enemy starts with or builds early Arclights, build fangs instead of crawlers as your chaff unit. This allows you to get the shield technology for the fangs later and lock the Arclights in place. Keep in mind that the charged shot counters all medium units, so avoid relying too heavily on them if you face Arclights. Building a few Sledges or Steel Balls is acceptable to tank the Arclights, attempt to bait out the charged shot, and then sell them. If the enemy is attempting a carry Arclight strategy, exploit their lack of antiair by using air units to force them off Arclights. This provides time to transition into Fortresses with fang summoning, which can demolish carry Arclight attempts.
*   **Arclight Builds:** Some highlighted Arclight builds are listed. Surrey's Arclight build is mentioned. Surrey typically uses Arclights without technologies against crawlers. Range is sometimes used if there is a lot of enemy chaff and Arclights die before clearing it. Against aggressive Steel Balls, Charged Shot is preferred first as range is not needed. Anti-air is often dropped in favor of building two packs of Mustangs. Armor is less useful but can be good against Mustangs.
*   **Arclight Technologies:**
    *   **Elite Marksman:** Increases range by 5m and ATK by 25% per level. Cost: 300. **Very powerful late game**, unlocking potential on Arclights. With levels, Elite Marksman, and Charged Shot, they can obliterate everything. Viability depends on play style.
    *   **Charged Shot:** Increases ATK by 200%. Cost: 300. Makes Arclights good against Sledgehammers and Steel Balls. A typical scenario is using Charged Shot Arclights to obliterate Steel Ball + Crawler pushes.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** Increases HP by 35% and reduces damage received by 60 per level. Cost: 150. **Very good tech when flanking** with Arclights, as Mustangs or Crawlers are usually present. Only use when flanking or defending a push to pin down enemy small units.
    *   **Anti-Aircraft Ammunition:** Enables use against aerial units. Cost: 300. The idea is to make Arclights all-around units. In reality, this tech is often too expensive, and it's better to build another unit type like Mustangs. A significant problem is high-leveled Arclights getting stuck on shielded Wasps instead of larger targets.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Usually a first or second Arclight tech. The main benefit mid and late game is that Arclights stay back and survive longer to clear enemy chaff.
    *   **Electromagnetic Shot:** Causes electromagnetic interference, temporarily disabling target tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 200. It's essential to have EMP on some core units. Arclights are a good option due to decent splash damage and low cost. Can disable Crawler acid or Mech Div Steel Balls.

#### Crawler

*   **Used against:** Fang, Hacker, Marksman, Melting Point, Steel Ball, Stormcaller, Sabertooth, Scorpion
*   **Countered by:** Arclight, Vulcan, Rhino, Wraith, Sledgehammer, Fire Badger, Typhoon, Tarantula
*   **How to play Crawler:** The Crawler is the most versatile unit. **Always useful**, well-placed Crawlers can win the early game. Packs of Crawlers can distract enemies for a long time in the late game. After the enemy develops counters, protect Crawlers by placing tanky units in front of them, causing enemy units like Vulcans to target the tanks, allowing Crawlers to move freely. They are a very aggressive unit that performs well in flanks. Even when deployed far back, their high speed allows them to arrive in time for battle. Crawlers are easy to "drip feed" into battle to protect higher value units due to their speed. Their usual use is to **absorb enemy fire and pull key units away**, but they are dangerous with technologies. Cheap Crawlers can poke defenses, and a surprise attack with two technologies in a single turn is possible. Some notes on 1v1: a level 2 Crawler always beats a level 1 Crawler with one technology. If all Crawlers are level 1, the ranking from best to worst is Impact Drill, then Replicate, then Mechanical Rage.
*   **Mechabellum Crawler counter:** The normal counter for early game Crawlers is to match them with Arclights. If the enemy develops more or techs them, the **best option is the Wraith**, which has multiple targets and clears Crawlers effectively. Other good options include Fire Badgers, Typhoons, Whirlwind Rhinos, Vulcans, or any unit with fire damage. Crawlers are hard to counter effectively just by buying units; positioning is critical. One trick is to place a forward-positioned Fang in front of your Vulcan to draw all enemy Crawlers to that spot. If they have Replicate, sell your isolated units to prevent them from being farmed.
*   **Crawler Builds:** Some highlighted Crawler builds are listed. Surrey's Crawler build is mentioned as the best, though he notes Acid would replace Mechanical Rage if used. He usually uses Crawlers without technologies. He sometimes commits to Replicate if the enemy provides opportunities to farm units. After Replicate, he goes into Impact Drill and then Mechanical Rage, but only if the enemy reacts poorly or is occupied elsewhere. If Subterranean Blitz is used, it's usually the only technology for that pack. It can be good against fire and weak clear units like Mustangs and Fangs.
*   **Crawler Technologies:**
    *   **Acidic Explosion:** Destroyed Crawlers leave acid area (9m radius) dealing 6% HP/sec and reducing DEF. Cost: 200. Good against giant units like Fortress and War Factory. Tricky to deploy late game, iffy response, countered by Photon Coating next turn. Risk of forward Crawlers being replicated.
    *   **Impact Drill:** Increases ATK by 125%. Cost: 200. Good for winning Replicate wars against bigger Crawlers. Also good versus leveled towers. Consider this if the enemy has a serious Crawler problem with no good answer, as Crawlers can then defeat giants, Sledgehammers, etc..
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Increases movement speed by 5m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.4s. Cost: 200. Usually the last technology for carry Crawlers. Damage is "crazy" paired with Impact Drill. Movement speed bonus is huge for connecting faster and running through fire.
    *   **Replicate:** Uses destroyed enemies to create more Crawlers. Cost: 250. **Probably the best technology in the entire game**. Creates a "subgame" around leveling Crawlers in dangerous positions. Can instantly turn the tide of battle on flanks or in the main fight. Mastering this tech can lead to fast rank increases. Do not tech before the first free unit drops due to high counter probability.
    *   **Subterranean Blitz:** Increases movement speed by 3m/s, tunnels underground when no enemies within 50m, nullifies 50% of damage received while tunneled, emerges near enemy to attack. Cost: 300. A "shield" technology. Tech especially against Mustang, Fangs, and fire. Ok against everything else. Stronger with leveled Crawlers. Never use with carry Crawlers; other carry techs are better.

#### Fang

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Mustang, Stormcaller, Vulcan, Typhoon, Tarantula
*   **Countered by:** Crawler, Mustang, Stormcaller, Vulcan, Typhoon, Tarantula (Note: Crawler, Mustang, Stormcaller, Typhoon, and Tarantula are listed as both used against and countered by Fang in the source.)
*   **How to play Fang:** Fangs are a chaff unit used to distract the opponent. Building damage-dealing fangs with technologies is described as a bad idea. The main value of Fangs as chaff comes from the **Portable Shield technology**, which allows them to survive two shots, and their slow movement speed, which lets them walk slowly in front of critical units late game. Starting enemy setup dictates if you should build Fangs as chaff; they are good against Sledgehammer and Arclight starts because the shield tech can lock these units in place indefinitely.
*   **Mechabellum Fang counter:** Countering Fangs depends heavily on other enemy units and deployment. Early game, you can run through Fangs with Crawlers or Mustangs (especially with explosive ammo). Stormcallers can bomb them, which is more effective with fire/high-explosive ammo. Against shielded Fangs, fire, Vulcans, Typhoons, or Mustangs are eventually needed.
*   **Fang Builds:** Some highlighted Fang builds are listed. Surrey's Fang build is mentioned. Surrey usually doesn't tech Fangs. Portable Shield is used mid-game if enemy chaff clear is slow single-target damage like Arclights or Sledges. Other techs are only used with Fortress's Fang Summoning technology. Mech Rage is good in that situation for crawler clear and protecting the Fort from Melting Points. Ignite can be useful against Energy Absorption Melting Points or War Factories.
*   **Fang Technologies:**
    *   **Ignite:** Attacks have chance to ignite (6% HP/sec for 2s). Cost: 300. Great against giants. Used with Fortress's Fang Summoning against Melting Points and War Factories. Don't upgrade unless a giant is directly in front.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Enables carry Fangs, but carry Fangs are considered "really bad". Avoid this technology.
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Increases movement speed by 5m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.5s. Cost: 300. Good with Fortress's Fang Summoning to protect the Fort faster from Melting Points and clear crawlers quicker.
    *   **Armor-Piercing Bullets:** Increases ATK by 50%. Cost: 250. A late game carry fang technology. Advised against going carry Fangs.
    *   **Portable Shield:** Energy shield absorbs damage equal to HP and blocks at least one instance. Cost: 450. **Very good when using Fangs as a meat shield**. Good if the enemy board has slow, single-target damage like Whirlwind/Exploding Rhinos, Scorpions, Fortresses, Arclights, Sledgehammers, etc..

#### Farseer

*   **Used against:** Wasp, Wraith, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Rhino, War Factory
*   **How to play Farseer:** The Farseer provides a **huge power spike mid game**, typically around rounds 3-5, but falls off quickly afterward. It's a versatile unit with okayish chaff clear, enough damage for Sledges and Balls, prevents enemy Wasp plays, is good against Wraith, and counters Overlords the turn they appear. It protects against "random cheese plays". Teching this unit and building more of them can lead to losses against better late-game units. The range tech is not recommended. EMP is sometimes good due to its low cost. When pushing, disabling enemy Vulcans, Wraiths, or Melting Points with Farseer EMP can be a very strong play. It may not work well in long-range games as range tech is needed, potentially leaving you behind on other essential units.
*   **Mechabellum Farseer counter:** To counter Farseers, avoid building too many Wasps, Phoenix, or Wraith in the mid game. Transition faster into giants when you see Farseers. Depending on positioning, Rhinos can also be very good. Normal anti-missile devices are less effective, but a War Factory "does wonders".
*   **Farseer Builds:** Some highlighted Farseer builds are listed. Surrey's Farseer build is mentioned. Surrey notes the unit has a short shelf life (2-3 rounds) and is cautious about teching it. He usually doesn't tech it, sometimes techs EMP, and rarely techs Photon.
*   **Farseer Technologies:**
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Farseer has enough range; save your money.
    *   **Electromagnetic Explosion:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling target tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 100. **The best and should be most used technology** on Farseer. Very strong against teched giants, wraiths, and even some lower priority targets. The cost of 100 makes it very valuable and easy to pick.
    *   **Photon Coating:** (Listed without description). Cost: 400. **Very good technology** if you get the Farseer drop when you need photon. Keep in mind it's ground only.
    *   **Scanning Radar:** Aura increases range of allied units within 100m by 10 (doesn't stack). Cost: 300. **Way too expensive** for the effect; requires deploying multiple Farseers to cover relevant units.

#### Fire Badger

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang, Mustang
*   **Countered by:** Sabertooth, Fortress, Hacker, Marksman, Overlord, Phoenix, Rhino, Scorpion, War Factory
*   **How to play Fire Badger:** The Fire Badger is a **rare unit** only available from free unit packs. It's often picked due to its economy value. **Very strong against crawlers**, demolishing them without needing technologies. Against Fangs and Mustangs, range might be needed, but it's considered better to use the Fire Badger only against crawlers. It can be a very strong flanker, pulling and killing piled-up enemy chaff. Use it similarly to Sledgehammers as a frontline tank that clears chaff for your damage units.
*   **Mechabellum Fire Badger counter:** When you see Fire Badgers, build Fangs as chaff instead of Crawlers due to the Fire Badger's short range. Midgame counters include armored Sledgehammers to tank damage or transitioning directly into Fortresses.
*   **Fire Badger Builds:** Some highlighted Fire Badger builds are listed. Surrey's Fire Badger build is mentioned. He considers it a frontline tank that clears chaff, with Field Maintenance being the best technology.
*   **Fire Badger Technologies:**
    *   **Scorching Fire:** Increases ATK by 125%. Cost: 250. Used against medium units like Sledgehammers and Steel Balls and to counter Armor technology.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Probably good against Fangs and Mustangs due to its low base range.
    *   **Liquid Fire:** Attacks ignite ground within 15m for 20s, dealing 350 damage/sec. Cost: 200. **Very strong against leveled, Subterranean Blitz Crawlers** especially.
    *   **Ignite:** Attacks have chance to ignite (6% HP/sec for 2s). Cost: 200. **Never tech Ignite**. Its short range makes it ineffective unless further investment is made, which is better spent on other units.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** Increases HP by 30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. **Very strong technology** for a frontline tank like the Fire Badger. Usually the only tech Surrey picks for Fire Badgers.

#### Fortress

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Rhino, Sledgehammer, Vulcan, Wasp, Hacker, Overlord, Phoenix, Typhoon, Scorpion
*   **Countered by:** Crawler, Melting Point, Overlord, Stormcaller, Steel Ball
*   **How to play Fortress:** The Fortress is a **very versatile giant**. It can be teched to handle various board states. You can use a few, level them, or mass them with no levels and Fang Summoning. Use Fortresses against Sledgehammers, Typhoons, Firebadgers, and other medium units. **Very strong against Vulcans** due to its ability to shield fire and quickly defeat Vulcans. Strong against air units because it counters them with Anti-air Barrage and demolishes their tanking units. If the enemy masses or techs Phoenix early, Anti-air Fortress is an easy counter as Phoenix relies on single-target damage. It's **hard to counter** due to tricks like beaconing, Barrier tech vs acid/EMP/spells, and Fang Summoning/shields vs high damage. Playing correctly, massing Fortresses wins against mass Overlords or any Air army.
*   **Mechabellum Fortress counter:** The **best counter is a Melting Point**. You will eventually need fire or Mustangs to deal with Fang Summoning. Late game against mass Forts, EMP Melters and incendiary Vulcans are good. Steel Balls are also a solid option, described as a 50/50 matchup depending on tempo, level, and item lead. War Factory anti missile can counter Anti-air Barrage or Rocket Punch. Acid Crawlers might be good if timed perfectly, but it's difficult.
*   **Fortress Builds:** Some highlighted Fortress builds are listed. Surrey's Fortress build is mentioned as the best, by far. Rocket Punch is the only flex slot. This setup offers the most opportunities to switch into Fortresses. They counter most board states with this technology setup. Surrey looks for enemy overcommitment into air (Phoenix) or medium units (Sledgehammers, Typhoons) to justify going Fortress. Anti-Air Barrage is teched against multiple air units or air units with tech, making selling out impossible. Barrier is used against fire, or as extra HP vs carry Arclights. Fang Summoning protects from single target damage; pair with Fang Shield if enemy lacks clear. Rocket Punch is used for chaff clear vs Replicate or to combat air units by clearing ground units/towers.
*   **Fortress Technologies:**
    *   **Rocket Punch:** Launches fists when HP below 85% and 55%. Range 180m, 15,000 damage + 15,000/level within 25m radius. Cost: 300. A bit bugged and unreliable but still **very good**. Big tempo play and quick Crawler clear.
    *   **Launcher Overload:** Attack interval -50%, range -20m. Cost: 200. **Very good** on the line with the enemy. Clears chaff and medium units very fast. Often needs Range tech too, making it expensive and requiring dropping another tech slot.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Could be useful for slamming Forts early vs chaff, forcing enemy into Melting Point. Other technologies are generally better.
    *   **Doubleshot:** Fires 2 shells/attack, reload time +12%. Cost: 200. Normal damage is sufficient once connected. Nerfs its okayish chaff clear.
    *   **Barrier:** Generates large shield (HP +40,000/level) for allies within it. Cost: 300. **Lots of value with multiple Fortresses** due to huge HP. Very good against fire, acid, sentry missiles, or spells.
    *   **Fang Summoning:** Produces 12 Fangs every 28s. Cost: 300. **Very powerful late game** to protect Fortress from Melting Points, Scorpions, or other high damage.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Disliked by Surrey as it makes Fortresses stay back instead of tanking/providing barrier. For a "pipe dream" carry Fortress. Good with Launcher Overload and High Range Fortress card.
    *   **Anti-Air Barrage:** Launches 16 anti-air barrages every 10s. Damages only aerial units, 900 damage/missile, 180m range. Cost: 200. **Most important technology**, countering troublesome boards (Ball/Wasp push, Boat/Sledge comp). Scales with items but not levels.
    *   **Elite Marksman:** Range +5m, ATK +25% per level. Cost: 200. Cheap for the effect, but high level Fortress is usually a liability. High level Fortress with Elite Marksman + Range is almost unbeatable if "stars align".

#### Hacker

*   **Used against:** Steel Ball, Sledgehammer, Rhino, Scorpion, Melting Point, Fire Badger, Arclight
*   **Countered by:** Overlord, Fortress, Stormcaller, Crawler, Fang, Phoenix, Wraith, War Factory
*   **How to play Hacker:** The Hacker is a **risky unit** against diverse boards. It can steal relevant enemy units or small units that distract the whole army. Strong early against Sledgehammers, Steel Balls, Rhinos, etc., but requires a same-level Hacker for reliable hacks. **Don't pair with strong single target damage**, as they will kill the units the Hacker is trying to hack. Good against Scorpions and Melting Points, which get distracted by hacked units. Better when the enemy has less fast chaff clear (Mustangs, Vulcans), allowing hacked units to distract longer. If using early Hackers, pair with units that kill barriers fast (like Storms) to avoid counters.
*   **Mechabellum Hacker counter:** (No specific section for Hacker counter in the provided text, but units that counter Hacker are listed in the Used against/Countered by section).
*   **Hacker Builds:** Some highlighted Hacker builds are listed. Surrey's Hacker build is mentioned. **Range is usually the first tech** to keep Hackers safe and distracting. Multiple Control is used sometimes with high level Hacker against lots of chaff or low level medium units. Barrier is good to protect units near Hackers from fire or sentry missiles when pushing. Enhanced Control is not useful often, sometimes teched against big flankers or in casual modes.
*   **Hacker Technologies:**
    *   **Electromagnetic Interference:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 100. A "strange" technology on Hacker, but very cheap and slows enemies. Great for slowing Rhinos running towards you. Good against Assault Marksmen (deletes HP buff, hacks instantly), though other counters are preferred.
    *   **Enhanced Control:** Units under control recover max HP. Cost: 300. Very expensive. Sometimes good vs big flankers for easy hacks/new army development. Good in casual modes (FFA, survival) for hacking bosses with full health.
    *   **Barrier:** Generates shield (HP +20,000/level) for allies within it. Cost: 300. Good tech to protect units around Hackers from fire or sentry missiles when pushing close to the line.
    *   **Multiple Control:** Range -25m, launches 5 control beams (17% original efficiency each). Cost: 250. **Sometimes "crazy" with a high level Hacker**. Requires lots of enemy chaff or low level medium units. Never tech if something high level is in front.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. **Very good and enables Hacker's power**. Allows Hacker to live longer by staying in a safer position.

#### Hound

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang
*   **Countered by:** Fire Badger, Rhino, Scorpion, Raiden, Typhoon, Vulcan, Wraith, Sandworm
*   **How to play Hound:** The Hound pairs **very well with all late game compositions**, making it a premium unit. It clears chaff well and provides multiple bodies, valuable late game to protect bigger units (especially from Melting points) and help them connect faster. Even used early without techs, they are useful later. Pairs well with everything, especially Overlords, Raidens, and War Factories. They are strong to commit into early because they level fast and can clear bigger units with levels. Usually tech Range early (around round 3) and Mech Rage later if the enemy handles them poorly. The Fire technology is risky due to heavy counter from anti-missile technologies and devices. One anti-missile device can stop one Hound from igniting oil.
*   **Mechabellum Hound counter:** Against aggressive Hounds, **Wraith or Vulcan are the best options**. Fire Badgers and even Mustangs also work but are countered by Hound armor. If you see enemy Fire Hounds early, immediately get anti-missile Mustangs. Wasps are generally a good idea against Hounds, forcing the enemy composition in a direction they might not want to go. Wasps are also amazing against Hound flanks.
*   **Hound Builds:** Some highlighted Hound builds are listed. Surrey's Hound build is mentioned. He notes Armor seems super strong but also super expensive. He prefers Fire over Mech Rage.
*   **Hound Technologies:**
    *   **Incendiary Bomb:** Launches 1 incendiary bomb every 16s (120m max, 40m min range). Cost: 300. Fire is **very strong against all light units**. With a 100-cost unit, they can be strategically positioned where fire matters. Hound Range tech seems to affect fire connection speed.
    *   **Light unit targeting:** Lock-on priority given to lowest HP enemy unit in range when switching target. Cost: 150. Might be a very strong late game technology.
    *   **Fire Extinguisher:** Clears fire and acid within 30m. Cost: 200. **Absolutely crazy tech** against enemy fire or spells. Position Hounds in front of Crawlers or Mustangs for protection.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +20%, reduces damage received by 60 per level. Cost: 400. **Very strong technology** on a 100 cost unit; can "brick" multiple enemy damage sources like Mustangs/Vulcans. Very costly, so value varies.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Probably the **first technology** on this unit unless used explicitly to clear fire.
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Increases movement speed by 4m/s and reduces attack interval by 0.8s. Cost: 300. **Strong technology** as attack speed increases their main role (chaff clear).

#### Marksman

*   **Used against:** Phoenix, Overlord, Vulcan, Arclight, Sledgehammer
*   **Countered by:** Crawler, Fang, Stormcaller, Wasp, Fortress, Rhino
*   **How to play Marksman:** In passive starts where units deploy near towers, Marksmen shine due to range. It's important they connect high damage shots to valuable targets. Even late game, 4-5 Marksmen are usually enough. Success depends on who clears small units (chaff) faster. If bought early, they level quickly and are cheap to level, not hindering deployments. You cannot switch into Marksmen later; Phoenix is better at that point as you get two per deployment.
*   **Mechabellum Marksman counter:** (No specific section for Marksman counter in the provided text, but units that counter Marksman are listed in the Used against/Countered by section).
*   **Marksman Builds:** Some highlighted Marksman builds are listed. Surrey's Marksman build is mentioned. He doesn't think Marksman is a good unit and uses it in a more niche role. He uses them only for **countering Wraiths and Overlords with Aerial Specialization**. Assault Mode is used for better success with bad openings (like Mustang+Crawler). Shooting Squad is only for a Round 2 subsidized Marksman card situation.
*   **Marksman Technologies:**
    *   **Aerial Specialization:** ATK +75% to air, range +30m vs air. Cost: 200. Gives a **very clear and powerful role**. Very useful against early Wraiths or Overlords.
    *   **Assault Mode:** Range -70, HP +500%, movement speed +3, 9m area damage. Cost: 150. Helps turn bad defensive starts into okay aggressive ones. Can use Marksmen as frontline. Don't overcommit; easily countered (best counter is Fortress).
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Marksmen are "all about range". Probably the **first tech 90% of the time** (depending on playstyle).
    *   **Quick Reload:** Multiplies attack speed at cost of lower damage. Cost: 300. Helps clear medium units faster. Good vs Hackers, late Fangs, Assault Marksmen. Generally favored over Doubleshot due to clearing chaff faster and hitting more targets when multiple Marksmen target the same unit. Essential for getting early levels. Surrey always goes Elite before Quick Reload. Argued that if relying on Snipers to kill big targets, the game is already lost.
    *   **Electromagnetic Shot:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 300. **Very useful**. Counters respawning Phoenixes, holds giants, disables range upgrades. Need EMP on a core unit; Marksman is an option.
    *   **Elite Marksman:** Range +8m, ATK +20% per level. Cost: 400. **Enables Marksman to be powerhouse late game**. Usually the second tech after Range.
    *   **Shooting Squad:** Summon 5 Fangs (same level) at combat start. Cost: 300. Good technology. Can build "too many" Marksmen early to level them, then use this to create a frontline. Other techs are usually better. Especially good with early subsidized Marksman card.
    *   **Doubleshot:** Fires 2 bullets/attack, reload time +15%. Cost: 300. Quick Reload is better. Doubleshot can cause overkill on medium units. While better vs high HP/shield units, Quick Reload's speed allows Marksmen to connect to new targets faster, and multiple Marksmen overkill less often. In the late game, Quick Reload generally performs better. Only exception might be when other units provide overwhelming fire clear.

#### Melting Point

*   **Used against:** Fortress, Rhino, Vulcan, Wraith, War Factory, Scorpion, Typhoon
*   **Countered by:** Steel Ball, Crawler, Marksman, Phoenix, Stormcaller, Hacker
*   **How to play Melting Point:** Used against **high health units**. This includes enemy giants (Fortress, Vulcan) or leveled/itemized medium units with super heavy armor. Should be your standard response when you see a Fortress, and sometimes against War Factory or Vulcan. Usable against Wraiths and Overlords. Scale very well into the late game with options like Crawler Summoning and/or EMP Barrage.
*   **Mechabellum Melting Point counter:** Melting Points rely on hitting high value targets. **Distracting them is the best immediate option**. Enemy often pairs them with fast chaff clear (Vulcans), so using Sledge Hammers or Steel Balls to block damage is a good play. **Steel Balls are the hard counter**. They can tank damage for your giants or kill Melters if teched. They are good even against multi-beam Melters with Range + Energy Absorption. Hackers also work great by hacking small units, causing the Melting Point to retarget frequently, buying time for other units like Fortresses to clear them.
*   **Melting Point Builds:** Some highlighted Melting Point builds are listed. Surrey's Melting Point build is mentioned. He usually goes Range first. Crawler Summoning is added if massing them. EMP is used if needing fast shield clear. Energy Absorption is good against Fortresses.
*   **Melting Point Technologies:**
    *   **Energy Absorption:** HP +40%, converts damage dealt to HP. Cost: 200. Makes leveled Melting Points "invincible". Hard countered by EMP, which denies range and absorption. Usually better to get EMP Barrage yourself. Can be a game-winning tech in some situations. Primarily used vs Fortresses.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. **The most important tech**. Usually the first tech purchased. Allows deployment in backline while still connecting to enemy giants.
    *   **Crawler Summoning:** Produces 10 Crawlers every 30s. Cost: 300. **Very powerful tech** as it protects your Melting Point. Used late game with multiple Melting Points.
    *   **Electromagnetic Barrage:** Launches 16 electromagnetic shots every 13s (180m range). Deals 4,000 shield damage, slows, disables tech for 13s. Cost: 300. Can build Melting Points solely for this tech. **Very good late game to counter shields**. Sometimes first or second tech. Can combo with spells (smoke bomb, oil, incendiary bomb) to get them through immediately.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Might be good as a second or third tech sometimes. Armor isn't as useful against high damage sources, but exceptions exist.
    *   **Energy Diffraction:** Range -30m, fires 5 rays (17% damage each). Cost: 250. Usually okay against medium units (Sledgehammers, Steel Balls). Can clear Crawlers if enough Melters. Whole comp shut down by EMP if relying on this.

#### Mustang

*   **Used against:** Fang, Phoenix, Wasp, Crawler
*   **Countered by:** Arclight, Sledgehammer, Stormcaller, Vulcan, Fortress, Rhino, Fire Badger, Typhoon, Tarantula
*   **How to play Mustang:** Mustangs are a **solid all-around unit** that can be teched for many purposes. Can be your army's main damage dealer. Excellent against Fangs early, okay against Crawlers, provide protection against early air. Kill everything late game with levels and items. High speed allows flank deployment even when pushing. Be careful not to build too many late game; they need support against counters. After 3-4 packs, invest in supporting units. Biggest enemies are armor technologies, big units, and shields. Pair with Hackers, Fortresses, Steel Balls, or Rhinos.
*   **Mechabellum Mustang counter:** Lots of ways to counter Mustangs. Early game: Arclights or Sledgehammers are convenient (also clear chaff). Stormcallers are good if paired with Fangs or other slow units. Mid/Late game: **Pin down with Armor technologies or giant units**. Armored Sledges or Fortresses with Barrier are used to lock them down. Once targeted by bigger units, smaller units (that Mustangs counter) like Wasps or Crawlers can operate. Against leveled/itemized Mustangs late game, consider Vulcan with Incendiary Bomb, and Melting Point + EMP to clear shields.
*   **Mustang Builds:** Some highlighted Mustang builds are listed. Surrey's Mustang build is mentioned. He finds them sometimes a liability lately. He dislikes using them as they become critical counters (Wasps, Fangs) but can get pinned down by armor techs, losing their role. **Range is usually his only technology**. High-Explosive Ammo is for crawlers, Aerial spec for multiple Overlords or Mass Wasps, and Missile intercept if Mustangs lack levels vs Storm fire.
*   **Mustang Technologies:**
    *   **High Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +7m, ATK -40%. Cost: 200. Does a lot vs Fangs, Crawlers, Wasps. Consider vs enemy leaning into Crawler. Good answer vs Crawlers if already in Mustangs, but another unit (Wraith) is better if not.
    *   **Armor-Piercing Bullets:** Increases ATK by 50%. Cost: 300. Late game tech for high level carry Mustangs. Great vs barrier shields, Sledgehammers, Overlord, armor units. Always buy Range first. Less valuable with other ATK buffs (like Advanced Firepower Control System) as buffs are additive.
    *   **Aerial Specialization:** ATK +90% to air, range +30m vs air. Cost: 300. **A must have tech for inevitable air battles**. Don't upgrade too early; unupgraded are decent vs Wasps/Phoenixes early. Main benefit is range, allowing Mustangs to stay back from Vulcans/fires and shoot air. Use when enemy has 3+ Overlords/Wasps or has teched their air units.
    *   **Missile Intercept:** Attempts to intercept missiles within 150m (battlefield skills not intercepted). Efficiency decreases over time, independent of level. Cost: 200. **Very powerful tech**, a way to fight Stormcallers. Mustangs use all shots on missiles, rendering other techs useless. Level 3 Mustangs intercept same amount as level 1 (no need to upgrade levels for this). Roughly 1 Mustang group needed per 1 Stormcaller group. **Very niche**, pressing at the wrong time can lose the game.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. **This is what makes Mustangs tick**. Good early, especially vs Fangs, but also everything else. Later, helps avoid incendiary fire by staying back. **Needed almost always**. Mustangs level faster if they don't die, and this helps prevent death.

#### Overlord

*   **Used against:** Rhino, Steel Ball, Sledgehammer, Stormcaller, Vulcan, Arclight, Hacker, Scorpion, Fire Badger, Sabertooth, Typhoon, War Factory, Wraith
*   **Countered by:** Marksman, Melting Point, Phoenix, Mustang, Fortress
*   **How to play Overlord:** The Overlord is a **backline damage dealer that needs protection**. Pairing them with Rhinos, Steel Balls, or Sledge Hammers is recommended. Puts a lot of pressure on the enemy tower. Countered by long-range shooters like Phoenix and Marksmen. Best used as an **aggressive unit** rather than in a standard long-range game.
*   **Mechabellum Overlord counter:** As with any giants, keeping it busy with Crawlers or Fangs is critical. To kill the Overlord, you need Marksmen, Phoenixes, Melting Points, or Aerial spec Mustangs. If it spawns Wasps (with Mothership tech), you need Fortress or Mustang for them.
*   **Overlord Builds:** Some highlighted Overlord builds are listed. Surrey's Overlord build is mentioned, noting many different builds and uses. If playing aggressively, **Photon is usually a must**, especially good with Steel Balls. Surrey usually tries a carry Overload formation with Sledges protecting and Overlords in back with Range + Launcher Overload. Mothership is for tanking Phoenix/Marksmen shots and forcing the enemy into Mustangs.
*   **Overlord Technologies:**
    *   **Overlord Artillery:** Install two ground-only cannons (120m range) attacking every 3s for 11,000 damage + 11,000/level. Cost: 350. **Strong against pushes** and very strong when pushing with Overlords and using mobile beacons for enemy tower. If Jump Drive is equipped, this tech should always be included. Very good against barrier and hackers (clears hacked units instantly). Note that Range + Overlord Artillery can result in Overlord range exceeding cannon range, potentially preventing trigger.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 150. Good against Fortress Anti-Air and Mustangs. Offers more situations to deploy Overlords and force enemy into Melting Points.
    *   **Launcher Overload:** Attack interval -50%, range -20m. Cost: 300. Considered necessary to avoid Missile Intercept. Usually paired with Range tech to prevent Overlords from walking too far forward. Without Range, Sledgehammers can outrange and can't tank for them.
    *   **Photon Emission:** Emits photon coating (30% damage reduction for 20s) to allies within 100m at combat start, grants immunity to electromagnetic, ignition, and acid effects. Cost: 350. **A must have technology** for aggressive strategies with Steel Balls or Rhinos. Useful vs Fortress Anti-Air or countering acid. Useful vs enemy pushes.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Surprisingly good. Specifically negates all Mustang damage, and there are sometimes many Mustangs. Health increase is also very relevant, especially with items.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. As the only technology, it's mostly useless. Must be paired with Launcher Overload for "true carry Overlords".
    *   **Mothership:** Produces 4 Wasps every 30s. Cost: 300. A way to protect Overlords from single target damage (Melting Points, Phoenix, Marksmen). Forces the enemy into Mustangs. Lots of value with mass boats.
    *   **Jump Drive:** Movement speed +5m/s, free repositioning during deployment. Cost: 200. **Very powerful** ability to move giant units. Can do "broken stuff" with mobile beacon. Not very useful mid game, makes Overlord build less versatile.
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +5m, ATK -40%. Cost: 100. Great against Crawler, Fangs, Wasps, and Mustangs. Very cheap, allows early Overlords vs chaff-heavy boards.

#### Phantom Ray

*   **Used against:** Fire Badger, Hacker, Mustang, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Stormcaller, Typhoon, Wraith
*   **Countered by:** Farseer, Marksman, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix, Raiden
*   **How to play Phantom Ray:** Serves as a **frontline for your air army**. Good damage vs medium units (Sledges, Steel Balls) and rapid shooting units like Mustangs (due to Armor technology). Would only build this unit to **"brick" enemy Mustangs by teching the Armor technology**. This provides a free round and a big problem for the enemy. After bricking Mustangs, enemy counters with Marksmen or Phoenix, which can be counteracted with the Shield technology. Has an extremely diverse tech pool and can be a huge damage dealer. Not good to start that way, but can build more later as damage after having Armor.
*   **Mechabellum Phantom Ray counter:** Avoid overcommitting to fast shooting units too early to avoid being countered by Armor. Countering depends on tech choices. Early: low amounts of Marksmen and Phoenix are good, need to win the chaff war. Massing them: **Overlords or Anti-air Wasps are the best option**. Multi Melter or regular Melter with Energy Absorption is also solid from unit drops. Missile interception Mustangs might work if enemy lacks other damage.
*   **Phantom Ray Builds:** Some highlighted Phantom Ray builds are listed. Surrey's Phantom Ray build is mentioned.
*   **Phantom Ray Technologies:** Available technologies for Phantom Ray, their viability and how to use them are listed. (Details are not provided in the source excerpt).

#### Phoenix

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Overlord, Rhino, Stormcaller, Vulcan, Typhoon, Sabertooth, Fire Badger, Scorpion
*   **Countered by:** Wasp, Marksman, Mustang, Fang, Fortress
*   **How to play Phoenix:** Phoenixes are a **very good harassment unit early game with Jump Drive**. Can flank, move to less anti-air spots, or counter cards like summon Overlord. Used to counter different pushes by moving to connect to big units. Can be used as long-range backline damage dealers, saving deployments compared to Marksmen (get 2 per pack). Teching too fast or building too many makes them vulnerable to Anti-Air Fortresses.
*   **Mechabellum Phoenix counter:** Has several early game counters: Fangs, Mustangs, or Marksmen. Later, Fortresses with Anti-Air Barrage can be good, especially if the Fortress also counters the unit paired with Phoenix. Anti-air connects to Phoenix even with units in front. Wasps can be good to either tank Phoenix damage or kill them with Aerial Specialization.
*   **Phoenix Builds:** Some highlighted Phoenix builds are listed. Surrey's Phoenix build is mentioned. He values mobility and plays them aggressively. Usually only techs Jump Drive, sometimes EMP vs Diffraction Melting Points or Charged Shot vs Rhinos/Wraiths. Range is standard but he never uses it due to his aggressive playstyle.
*   **Phoenix Technologies:**
    *   **Charged Shot:** Damage +175%, range -25m. Cost: 200. Phoenix usually overkills, normal damage often enough vs valuable targets. Can be very powerful if positioned correctly. Very powerful combined with Jump Drive. Mostly used vs shields, Rhinos, Wraiths, sometimes Overlords/leveled medium units. Decreased range makes Phoenix vulnerable without fast frontline or enemy pushing in.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. For players using Phoenix as a long-range sniper. Useless for Surrey's aggressive Jump Drive playstyle. Very good if positioning safer and not protecting Phoenix as much. Don't buy too early; focus on developing battlefield first. Enemy can't touch short range Phoenix if battlefield developed.
    *   **Elite Marksman:** Range +5m, ATK +25% per level. Cost: 400. Depends on playstyle. Can play Phoenix carry with Quantum Reassembly, Shield, Range, and Elite Marksman. Strong with Elite Phoenix card (recruits level 3 instantly).
    *   **Jump Drive:** Movement speed +5m/s, free repositioning during deployment. Cost: 50. **Best technology** for Phoenix in Surrey's opinion. Very powerful starting with Phoenixes or buying round 1. Allows aggressive positioning, flanking, countering Rhinos. Playstyle dependent; not useful late game, makes other techs more expensive.
    *   **Electromagnetic Shot:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 200. **Very powerful**. Need EMP on a core unit. Usually Stormcaller is best, but unreliable (missiles intercepted), so Phoenix is good to guarantee hit. Sometimes good vs Fortress Anti-Air, War Factories, Melting Points, or Wraiths.
    *   **Energy Shield:** Energy shield absorbs damage equal to HP, blocks at least one instance. Cost: 200. Surrey uses this less over time. Better payoff from positioning better and favoring damage techs. Can be very strong late game, in early flanks, or vs cards like Orbital Bombardment.
    *   **Launcher Overload:** Attack interval -50%, range -25m. Cost: 250. Good when defending or pushing. Charged Shot is better and cheaper, but this is safer as it clears irrelevant targets faster (less careful positioning needed). Range + Launcher Overload is a good combo but vulnerable to Fortress Anti-air.
    *   **Quantum Reassembly:** Destroyed cockpit follows nearest ally, fully restored in 15s (one trigger per battle). Cost: 300. Strong with mass produced Phoenix card, 2v2, or FFA. Good with Phoenixes on multiple fronts. Trick: mobile beacon one Phoenix to circle in back for resurrection. Easily countered by EMP Marksmen or EMP Wasps. Not great in 1v1, a "win more" tech. Can be useful vs spells like Lightning Storm/Orbital Bombardment.

#### Raiden

*   **Used against:** Fire Badger, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Stormcaller
*   **Countered by:** Farseer, Marksman, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix
*   **How to play Raiden:** The Raiden is like a **flying Scorpion**. It counters all medium units well. Struggles against high health targets early. Eventually counters everything with levels and items. Look for enemy overcommitment of medium units (sledgehammers, fire badgers, phantom ray, steel balls) to justify building Raiden. If they level and you find items, you can keep committing.
*   **Mechabellum Raiden counter:** The Raiden struggles heavily against chaff early. Building large numbers of Crawlers while using a single anti-air unit to kill distracted Raidens is a good starting counter. This buys time to build proper counters like Overlords. Can be countered by Marksmen and Phoenix, but you need to be ahead on chaff clear. Melting Points are sometimes amazing but leave you vulnerable vs medium units. Fortress Anti-air is a good option if early enough. With Forts, you usually need to build them on the same turn or before enemy Raidens.
*   **Raiden Builds:** Some highlighted Raiden builds are listed. Surrey's Raiden build is mentioned. He normally techs Range first, then Chain, then EMP. If enemy is close, he techs Chain first. Can go Range + Chain + Fork if frontline chaff clear is short-ranged.
*   **Raiden Technologies:**
    *   **Electromagnetic Shot:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 300. Because Raiden hits multiple targets, this tech is "insane". Shuts down every Raiden counter. Requires Range and Chain first, so almost always the third tech. Takes a long time to reach.
    *   **Ionization:** Attack -70%, adds 40% of target's current HP as damage. Cost: 100. Uncertain about this tech. In theory strong vs high HP, doesn't affect chaff clear, reduces damage vs medium units. Raiden is vulnerable to single squad high HP units (armored Rhino/Worm). Boards exist where this is correct, but EMP is often more versatile/better. Might be good with mass produced Raiden card.
    *   **Chain:** Range -20, lightning bolts jump to other enemies within 60 radius (25% damage). Cost: 300. Raiden has enough damage to easily kill all chaff and most medium/small units with this. Hits more targets than Fork. Attack can target further than normal Raiden range. Connects faster to light backline counters (Phoenix, Marksmen).
    *   **Fork:** Range -15, lightning bolts per attack increases from 3 to 5. Cost: 250. Chain is almost always better. Teching both can reduce range too much.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Raiden is a backline carry unit, so range is very valuable. Keeps Raiden safe, enables damage faster. Increases damage output by having more targets in range. Raiden hits 3 targets; loses 2/3 damage if only one target. Bigger range ensures multiple targets are almost always available.

#### Rhino

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Vulcan, Stormcaller, Crawler, Sledgehammer, Fire Badger, Marksman, Mustang, Typhoon
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Hacker, Melting Point, Steel Ball, Phoenix, Overlord, War Factory
*   **How to play Rhino:** It's an **aggressive unit that needs aggressive play**. Mostly used for shielding damage dealers. Can be dropped in front of enemy Vulcan to draw aggro for Crawlers. Great at taking down enemy towers, needs pushing from multiple directions to find a mobile beacon angle. Flexible due to different techs.
*   **Mechabellum Rhino counter:** Against aggressive Rhinos, use **charged shot Phoenix or Steel Balls deployed vertically**. Sometimes a Fortress. Melting Point vs high level/itemized Rhino. Need to predict mobile beacon paths and drop units in paths. Sentry missiles slow it down (negated by Power Armor tech). Early Hacker can work (needs damage and Fangs to keep in place). Jump Drive Phoenixes can position perfectly. Overlord with Ground Cannon is a solid choice. Beware Final Blitz tech: don't stack units, keep Rhino in place and shield explosion (Rhino outside shield). EMP counters Final Blitz for one round (countered by Photon Coating). Shielded Fangs waste time vs Whirl Wind Rhinos. Early War Factory shooting in all directions is powerful vs flank rushes.
*   **Rhino Builds:** Some highlighted Rhino builds are listed. Surrey's Rhino build is mentioned. Photon Coating makes itemized/leveled Rhinos stronger. Power Armor prevents missile hits during tower runs. Final Blitz good with mass produced Rhino or defensively. Whirlwind good vs chaff and medium units. He usually techs Whirlwind only. If Rhinos perform well, he adds Power Armor and builds a Photon Emission Overlord nearby.
*   **Rhino Technologies:**
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Movement speed +5m/s, attack interval -0.3s. Cost: 200. Movement speed is relevant in many situations. Whirlwind usually much better; teching both is often overkill.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** Restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. Might be insane with high level Rhinos from drops. Usually not great as Rhinos are countered by Steel Balls/Melting Points.
    *   **Wreckage Recycling:** Recovers HP equal to enemy HP upon destroying one. Cost: 100. Low cost, significantly increases power level early turns. A tempo play. May be desired depending on Rhino usage.
    *   **Final Blitz:** Self-destructs at 0 HP, deals damage equivalent to Max HP in 48m radius. Cost: 250. Not used every game, but adds flexibility, making it a must-pick. Serves as a scare tactic for opponent.
    *   **Photon Coating:** 30% damage reduction for first 25s, immunity to electromagnetic, ignition, acid effects. Cost: 300. **Significantly increases Rhino power**. Usually first or second tech.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Used to block fast shooting units (Mustangs). Enemy counters with Steel Balls if you tech this. Better to block damage with Sledgehammers (5 units vs 1, harder to clear).
    *   **Whirlwind:** Attacks all surrounding enemies over time (1.5x ATK damage) when multiple enemies are around. Cost: 250. **Insane** against Crawlers, Fangs, Sledgehammers, Mustangs, and any multi-unit squads.
    *   **Power Armor:** HP +25%, grants immunity to slow. Cost: 300. **Crazy tech for taking down towers**. Main benefit is countering sentry missiles (slow). Helps in base races (immune to tower death slow/oil). Most important tech for Rhino rushes with mobile beacon.

#### Sabertooth

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Steel Ball, Stormcaller, Fire Badger, Sledgehammer
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Hacker, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix, Rhino
*   **How to play Sabertooth:** A **rare unit** from free unit packs. Often provides the most economy value from packs, a solid choice. Build more only if: enemy has too few chaff or you have crazy chaff clear, enemy has decent medium units (balls, sledges, arcs, snipers), and enemy has 2+ Stormcallers performing a critical role. Don't use Missile Interceptor vs Overlords if they have Launcher Overload. A leveled Sabertooth with an item is always a big powerhouse early game.
*   **Mechabellum Sabertooth counter:** **Just overwhelm it with chaff**. If you get missile intercepted, tech Launcher Overload.
*   **Sabertooth Builds:** Some highlighted Sabertooth builds are listed. Surrey's Sabertooth build is mentioned. Usually, he doesn't tech anything and just sells them. Missile Interceptor is a very solid choice against storms. Field Maintenance is good with levels or items if the enemy doesn't have a Melter.
*   **Sabertooth Technologies:**
    *   **Field Maintenance:** HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. Okay technology for a frontline tank. A bit costly for its HP pool. Being a single unit makes it easy for enemy big units to lock onto it.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Best used as a frontline tank, don't want it too far back. Protect with chaff instead of teching range.
    *   **Missile Interceptor:** Tries to intercept missiles within 150m (battlefield powers not intercepted). Efficiency declines over time, independent of level/attack. Cost: 200. **Very strong technology**. Maybe the reason to get Sabertooths. One Sabertooth can interrupt about one Stormcaller.
    *   **Doubleshot:** Fires 2 shells/attack, reload time +12%. Cost: 100. This tech costing 100 makes Sabertooth a **crazy tempo unit**. Pick high level Saber, click this, delete enemy giants.

#### Sandworm

*   **Used against:** Fire Badger, Arclight, Marksman, Rhino, Sabertooth, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Typhoon, Vulcan, Tarantula, Mustang
*   **Countered by:** War Factory, Phoenix, Overlord, Steel Ball, Melting Point, Rhino
*   **How to play Sandworm:** The best use case is to **protect your Wasps with Sandstorm** against Mustangs and Fortress anti-air. Very usable in long-range games with Stormcallers and Vulcans (beaconing around, submerging to kill remaining storms). In asymmetrical games, you can mass worms + Replicate in the same position to produce a new army. Critical that firepower is concentrated so worms burrow/emerge more often.
*   **Mechabellum Sandworm counter:** Most of the Sandworm's potential relies on burrowing and emerging multiple times. **Pin down the Sandworm with lots of drip-fed chaff** to prevent this.
*   **Sandworm Builds:** Some highlighted Sandworm builds are listed. Surrey's Sandworm build is mentioned; it's a new unit so less experience. Likes using it aggressively paired with Wraiths, Crawlers, and sometimes Steel Balls. Usually only techs Sandstorm or Replicate. Mechanical Division is quite strong with multiple Sandworms.
*   **Sandworm Technologies:**
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Movement speed +4, attack interval -0.8s. Cost: 250. Very nice, both speed and faster attack are relevant. Better to invest in survival and support techs.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, reduces damage received by 60 per level. Cost: 200. Sandworm countered by heavy hitters; Armor Enhancement doesn't solve this. Quite cheap; might be pickable in some situations/playstyles.
    *   **Mechanical Division:** Destroyed Sandworm spawns four level one larvae. Cost: 250. **Very strong technology with multiple Sandworms** and enemy beam weapons.
    *   **Anti-Air:** Enables attacks against aerial targets. Cost: 250. Good vs Wraiths especially. Usually tech summoning, but AA allows massing if enemy counters with Overlords. Note: Sandworms might burrow away from air units to target towers.
    *   **Underground Maintenance:** Recovers 15% max HP/sec when burrowed. Cost: 250. Creates value only when burrowed. Really strong vs Overlords and other air units if not targeted. Not good vs beam weapons. Need to pair with summoning techs for protection vs Melting Point.
    *   **Replicate:** Creates one Larva each time a Sandworm emerges. Cost: 250. Especially strong if the fight is spread out. Creates value defending flanks or attacking from multiple angles. Mechanical Division has better numbers, but Replicate protects the initial Sandworm from dying.
    *   **Sandstorm:** Creates sandstorm (120m radius, 10s duration) when burrowing out. Cost: 300. (Further details cut off in source).

#### Scorpion

*   **Used against:** Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Arclight, War Factory
*   **Countered by:** Marksman, Phoenix, Stormcaller, Overlord
*   **How to play Scorpion:** Best use case is to **counter Steel Balls**. Second best is Sledgehammers, but this risks easy enemy switch into Overlords. Good vs enemy shields/barriers. Key is to **pair with good chaff clear** (Vulcans/Mustangs). Mistake to overcommit early; usually best to get one without techs initially. Late game: mass them with Range + Acid (very strong). Even one Scorpion tanks damage early and kills problem units (leveled balls/sledge). Very good against War Factory: attack destroys summons, acid deals with factory.
*   **Mechabellum Scorpion counter:** (No specific section for Scorpion counter in the provided text, but units that counter Scorpion are listed in the Used against/Countered by section).
*   **Scorpion Builds:** Some highlighted Scorpion builds are listed. Surrey's Scorpion build is mentioned. He mostly uses Scorpions without teching, chilling until enemy commits to balls/sledges, then sells and goes giants. If committing more, don't tech Range until they die too quickly. Important to be a frontliner and tank damage.
*   **Scorpion Technologies:**
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Field Maintenance is better.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** Restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. Used to be best tech, now "a little bit sad" after HP buff removal. Good with itemized/leveled Scorpions to force enemy into Melting Point.
    *   **Doubleshot:** Fires 2 shells/attack, reload time +12%. Cost: 300. Good vs Rhinos, Mech Div Steel Balls, shielded Fangs, giants. Very niche. Surrey wouldn't use it. Best vs Rhino pushes, but Steel Balls are preferred there.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Range is always good and usually needed. Don't tech too early; makes you vulnerable to Overlord switch. Better to use as frontline tank early. Consider Field Maintenance instead.
    *   **Siege Mode:** Enters siege mode (range +70m, ATK -35%, cannot attack within 75m), attack interval +1.5s. Cost: 300. Nice in theory; massed long-range Scorpions throwing acid late game sounds good. In reality, difficult to tech in time. Requires enemy serious mistakes to commit so heavily. Pretty good when the time is right.
    *   **Acid Attack:** Attack creates acid area (15m radius, 40s duration). Units in acid lose 3% HP/sec, take 250% damage when attacked. Cost: 300. Very late game tech usually. Very good if survived to stable board with ranged Scorpions.

#### Sledgehammer

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Mustang, Stormcaller
*   **Countered by:** Hacker, Fortress, Phoenix, Overlord, Scorpion, War Factory, Marksman, Rhino
*   **How to play Sledgehammer:** Early game chaff clear unit, performs well against Crawlers and Fangs. Good vs Crawlers throughout, gets stuck on shielded Fangs "for eternity". Midgame role: assist chaff clear, provide frontline for bigger units, tank against Typhoons, Vulcans, Wraiths. Don't tech too early (hard countered). Late game: tank Melting Points, nullify Mustangs with Armor Enhancement, clear Crawlers fast, offer solid damage boost. Vs heavy Stormcallers: Sledges + Crawlers is a good option (struggle round 1, good with speed/Mechanical Rage). Deploy vertically vs Steelballs. Not leveling them is often correct; counters are bad vs level 1 Sledges and overkill them. Level 1 Sledges perform main role similarly to higher levels (clear chaff same, still one shot by Scorpion).
*   **Mechabellum Sledgehammer counter:** Avoid building too many Crawlers; lean into Fangs for the option of Fang Shield later. Charged shot Arclight can be good vs Sledges + Crawlers. Scorpions are solid vs Sledgehammers but early unlock makes you vulnerable to Overlords. **Fortresses are very good**; also counter paired units (Marksmen, Arclight, Phoenix, Wasp) with anti-air or summoning shielded fangs. War Factory is another option in similar scenarios. Round 4-5 Factory strong if enemy only builds Sledges and no chaff. Hacker is a niche counter. Melting Point vs Damage Sharing tech.
*   **Sledgehammer Builds:** Some highlighted Sledgehammer builds are listed. Surrey's Sledgehammer build is mentioned. **Field Maintenance is the best technology**. Advised against teching Mech Rage early. Surrey's tech usage: ~60% Field Maintenance, 37% Armor, 3% Mech Rage, 0% Damage Sharing. Any "carry sledgehammer" build (range+emp+mech rage) is a bad idea and easily shut down.
*   **Sledgehammer Technologies:**
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Movement speed +4m/s, attack interval -1.5s. Cost: 300. Very good vs Stormcallers. Also good vs Crawlers/Fangs, but often better to clear slower and use Field Maintenance or Armor.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Part of the "carry sledge" kit, usually a bad tech as Sledges should tank. Can be good with the High Range Sledgehammer card.
    *   **Armor-Piercing Bullets:** ATK +150%, attack interval +20%. Cost: 250. Looks good in theory, but weakens main role (chaff clear). Might be good if opponent avoids Fangs/Crawlers. Huge damage boost vs medium/giant units or barriers.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +20%, reduces damage received by 60 per level. Cost: 300. Usually teched vs Mustangs or Vulcans. Can be very good vs Crawlers if they lack Impact Drill.
    *   **Electromagnetic Shot:** Causes electromagnetic interference on hit, disabling tech and reducing movement speed by 40%. Cost: 300. Counters nasty techs: armor enhancements, crawler acid, steel balls life steal, mechanical division. Might be needed for Sledge carry vs Rocket Punch Fortress or enemy Scorpion range. Surrey wouldn't use it but sees niche value in some playstyles.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 200. **Very good value for the money** at 200 cost. Almost always first (and only) tech. Good vs Sledgehammer mirrors or Stormcallers.
    *   **Damage Sharing:** Chains adjacent Sledgehammers (HP +120%), shares damage equally. Cost: 200. Some uses for fast power spikes or forcing enemy units. **Never buy if you don't know what you're doing**. Countered early by Steel Balls. Overkill damage (Melting Point, Steel Balls) is not wasted with this, doing more harm than good. A one-turn trick, but availability can make enemy make bad plays.

#### Steel Ball

*   **Used against:** Fortress, Rhino, Melting Point, Vulcan, War Factory, Fire Badger, Typhoon
*   **Countered by:** Crawler, Hacker, Phoenix, Overlord, Stormcaller, Scorpion
*   **How to play Steel Ball:** Quite vulnerable as starting units (heavily countered by free Scorpion drop). **Shine as reactionary units**. Provide good frontline for backline damage or tank for late Crawlers. Use against big single targets (Melting Points, Typhoons). Pretty much unstoppable with levels and items. With levels/items, can become invincible with Photon Emission Overlord support.
*   **Mechabellum Steel Ball counter:** Can be played and countered in many ways. **Scorpion is the most universal option**. Early Scorpion stops leveling. Other options: Overlords w/ Ground Cannon/Launcher Overload, Hackers, Arclights w/ charged shot, Degenerate Beam Wraith. Wraith is generally good vs units often paired with Steel Balls. If enemy is aggressive, use sentry missiles vs early leveling balls (deploy on your tower). Defending a push: deploy Fangs vertically in front of tower to gather balls, then blast with Stormcallers. Phoenix work if connected fast (need charged shot vs leveled balls), need enough chaff clear. Overwhelming with Crawlers is easy if not paired with Wraiths. Vulcan with damage tech/item good (Vulcan needs to be same level).
*   **Steel Ball Builds:** Some highlighted Steel Ball builds are listed. Surrey's Steel Ball build is mentioned. Pushing with beacon: Energy Absorption first if connecting to something. Reactionary vs Giants: Always Range first. Mechanical Division good with production line item, War factory, or bad enemy crawler clear. Armor good vs Mustangs (build Wasps behind to force Mustangs counterable by Armor).
*   **Steel Ball Technologies:**
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 350. Good against Mustangs. Building Wasps behind can force enemy into Mustangs, which Armor counters hard.
    *   **Heavy Target:** Range -10m, lock-on priority to highest HP unit in range when switching. Cost: 200. Sounds good on paper but never works out in practice. Pretty good with High Range Steel Ball card, but too niche.
    *   **Energy Absorption:** HP +40%, converts damage dealt to HP. Cost: 200. Makes early level 3+ Steel Balls "carry the game". Best against Giants and Barriers. Pair with photon boats for invincibility.
    *   **Damage Sharing:** Chains adjacent Steel Balls (HP +120%), shares damage equally. Cost: 250. Risky, better than on Sledgehammer. Sometimes good paired with life leech as a last turn surprise. Surrey still wouldn't equip it.
    *   **Mechanical Division:** Destroyed Steel Balls create 5 level 1 Crawlers. Cost: 350. **Must have tech** in Surrey's opinion. Forces opponent to prepare; an "out to win" if they don't. Good with Production Line item, War Factory, or bad enemy crawler clear. Really strong with subsidized steel ball card.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Good late game tech overall. Pretty good vs giants. Good vs Hackers and Rhinos (tech vs Whirlwind/Final Blitz Rhino to prevent death).

#### Stormcaller

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Fang, Melting Point, Vulcan, Mustang, Marksman, Fortress, Scorpion, Typhoon
*   **Countered by:** Overlord, Phoenix, Stormcaller, Crawler, Sledgehammer, Rhino, War Factory, Sabertooth
*   **How to play Stormcaller:** If unopposed, **one of the best units**. Melt low HP units (Fangs, Mustangs), great vs slow/stationary (giants, sledges, marksmen, arclights). One of the best units to bring down shields. Counter almost everything. Heavily countered by missile interceptor (device/techs). Delicate balance knowing when and how many to buy.
*   **Mechabellum Stormcaller counter:** A couple of Stormcallers can be countered by anti-missile devices (risky early economy loss). Late game mass Stormcallers: mass anti-missile devices. Crazy amounts/leveled/teched: War Factories with Missile Interception. Cost efficiently: **distract with Crawlers** (drip fed, beacon sideways, speed upgrade). Sledgehammer is a good start vs (struggle early, good with Field Maintenance/Mechanical Rage + level 2).
*   **Stormcaller Builds:** Some highlighted Stormcaller builds are listed. Surrey's Stormcaller build is mentioned. Doesn't tech heavily (zero or one tech). High-Explosive ammo usually first (chaff clear, cheap, no fire vs crawlers). Sometimes EMP vs Diffraction Melting points. Incendiary bomb late game vs summoned Fangs or igniting Oil patch. Launcher Overload only vs anti-missile (can fight them paired with overloaded Overlords).
*   **Stormcaller Technologies:**
    *   **Incendiary Bomb:** Attack ignites area (5.5m radius, 15s) dealing 350 damage/sec. Cost: 350. Not always used, but **can win the game or give huge advantage** when good. Beneficial to ignite Oil patch or counter shielded Fangs/mass Crawlers. High cost, risk of interception.
    *   **(Unnamed Tech):** Cost: 200. **Never ever tech this**; makes Stormcallers more easily interceptable.
    *   **Launcher Overload:** Attack interval -50%, range -40m, movement speed +5m/s. Cost: 300. Good vs missile intercept technologies.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Usually a "do nothing" tech. Storms already have long range, makes next tech too much commitment to interceptable unit. Best counter is distraction, so seldom benefits from range. Can be good depending on enemy play; Surrey uses it in many games. Best paired with Launcher Overload, but risky investment.
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +5m, ATK -40%. Cost: 200. Cheap tech that significantly increases chaff clear. Makes Storms ok vs Crawlers, instantly deletes Fangs. Beneficial vs Sledgehammers/Steel Balls, but not the reason to tech it.

#### Tarantula

*   **Used against:** Fang, Crawler, Mustang, Wasp
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Hacker, Marksman, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix, Rhino, Sabertooth, Scorpion, Sandworm, Steel Ball, War Factory, Stormcaller
*   **How to play Tarantula:** Has several strengths: **very tanky**, clears chaff well early, ok damage vs Sledgehammers/Arclights. Use vs board heavy in chaff + Arcs or Sledges. Needs to be a frontline unit to utilize high HP. Not a unit to commit into; use as a solid early game unit without teching. If you commit, do a push surrounding enemy base, tech Spider Mine first. Nice answer to Mustang heavy boards due to cheap armor tech.
*   **Mechabellum Tarantula counter:** Early game: get into Phoenixes, or use Wasp play (forces unwanted enemy units). The Tarantula unit itself is easy to deal with, but the **Spider Mines are the problem** (distract heavy hitters). Vulcan + air units is a good way to deal with mines. If enemy heavily commits to Tarantula, Hackers with Multihack can win. Fortress is good early as Tarantulas lack damage to kill them.
*   **Tarantula Builds:** Some highlighted Tarantula builds are listed. Surrey's Tarantula build is mentioned. He doesn't believe in this unit. Mostly uses it with Armor tech vs Mustangs or a Vulcan. Might push heavily with Spider Mines first and Range second if enemy has a very weak start.
*   **Tarantula Technologies:**
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +5m, ATK -30%. Cost: 150. Cheap and good chaff clear. Helps vs Crawlers, Fangs, loose Crawlers, shielded Fangs. Usually Surrey only uses one tech on Tarantulas, and this is never it.
    *   **Anti-Aircraft Ammunition:** Can be used against aerial units. Cost: 150. Surrey likes this a lot. Often plays Tarantulas with Jump Drive Wasps (forcing Mustangs vs armored Tarantulas), this helps if enemy counters with own Wasps.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. One of the stronger techs. Main purpose of unit is tanking. With level 2 Tarantulas early, this makes them "unkillable", forcing expensive counters. Risky as heavy hitter kills regardless of FM. Requires attention to enemy composition/next turn potential.
    *   **Armor-Piercing Bullets:** Increases ATK by 50%. Cost: 200. Cheap damage tech. Nice with Mechanical Rage. Problem: main role is chaff clear, damage not needed. A "carry Tarantula" tech, which is not the desired strategy.
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Movement speed +4m/s, attack interval -0.2s. Cost: 400. Expensive. Allows faster connection (speed) and more damage (attack interval). Attack interval reduction increases chaff clear significantly. Good for carry Tarantula, but not the usual strategy.
    *   **Spider Mine:** Fires 2 Spider Mines (750 HP) every 15s. Charge at enemy, self-destruct (4,500 damage in 9m radius). Attributes enhance with level (HP +750, damage +4,500 per rank). Cost: 300. **The best technology** for Tarantula. The power spike tech if committing to them. Clears crawlers, medium units, even enemy towers. Provides a lot of chaff for Tarantulas by taking heavy hits.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Range techs are usually strong, but Tarantula needs to use its high HP pool for tanking. Want it to walk forward and tank. Might be useful later if chaff clear depends on Tarantula and they die too fast to big targets.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, reduces damage received by 60 per level. Cost: 200. Cheap on Tarantula. Good niche tech to punish some Mustang heavy boards.

#### Typhoon

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang, Wasp, Mustang
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Marksman, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix, Rhino, Sabertooth, Scorpion, Steel Ball, War Factory
*   **How to play Typhoon:** A **rare unit** from free unit packs. A bigger, fairly tanky version of the Mustang. Like a Scorpion that kills chaff instead of big units. **Very strong against crawlers, fangs, and wasps**. Can deal damage to bigger things with items/levels. No range tech, but has Barrier tech. Use as part of your frontline. Best used aggressively or as a defender of aggression due to short range.
*   **Mechabellum Typhoon counter:** Can block damage with any medium units. **Best counters are Steel Balls, Fortresses, or Scorpions**. Steel Balls are very good (effective vs Barrier, can protect late Crawlers). Hackers would be good but struggle against the Barrier.
*   **Typhoon Builds:** Some highlighted Typhoon builds are listed. Surrey's Typhoon build is mentioned. Typhoons have quite strong technologies. Usually correct to tech Barrier first, unless enemy is already in Steel Balls or giants. Clears chaff very fast. Homing Missiles provide more damage than Mechanical Rage vs medium or giant units.
*   **Typhoon Technologies:**
    *   **Mechanical Rage:** Movement speed +4, ATK +50%. Cost: 300. Both movement speed and damage aspects are great. Makes Typhoon better as an aggressive unit. Usually better to tech Homing Missiles or Barrier first.
    *   **Aerial Specialization:** ATK +90% to air, range +30m vs air. Cost: 300. Obviously good vs all air units. Generally used only vs Wasps (Wraiths/Overlords too hard to kill, Phoenix outrange).
    *   **Barrier:** Generates shield (HP +11,000/level) for allies within. Cost: 300. Quite a strong tech. Note: 2 units in pack means total barrier strength is double. Deploy vertically for better mileage.
    *   **Homing Missile:** Launches 4 homing missiles every 8s (180m max, 60m min range). Deals 675 damage + 450/level. Cost: 300. Provides quite a lot more damage. Can snipe open tower due to high range. Best against medium unit heavy enemy boards.

#### Vulcan

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang, Mustang
*   **Countered by:** Fortress, Melting Point, Overlord, Phoenix, Rhino, Stormcaller
*   **How to play Vulcan:** Relatively **cheap for clearing everything small**. Success depends on pulling enemy chaff to a single position (forward fangs trick). Don't use vs aggression; go Wraith instead. Good vs medium units (Steelballs/Sledges) with +125% attack upgrade (+counters mechanical division). Pair with single target damage (Phoenix, Maskman, Overlord, Melting Point). Health and damage items are great. Cheap haste module is a good entry point.
*   **Mechabellum Vulcan counter:** When enemy goes Vulcan, **go Fortress**. Melting Point is also solid. If already in Steel Balls, you will outscale with Energy Absorption, levels, and Photon Coating Overlords. Armored Sledgehammers are also a good block.
*   **Vulcan Builds:** Some highlighted Vulcan builds are listed. Surrey's Vulcan build is mentioned. Best Partner is good vs Wraith pushes (summon Aerial Spec Marksmen). Sometimes good with senior manufacturing specialist. Incendiary Bomb vs Mustang or high chaff amounts. Range is risky (stuck on barrier/giants); need Melting Point with range first. Scorching flames vs medium units.
*   **Vulcan Technologies:**
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. **Very strong**, allows clearing faster and not walking into death. Be careful not to get stuck on big units due to added range.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Not a priority. Can be worth it in long range games where Vulcans are frontline and take damage from multiple sources. Not needed just vs light units.
    *   **Sticky Oil Bomb:** Fires sticky bomb every 16s (180m max, 40m min range) with deceleration. Cost: 250. Worse and cheaper Incendiary Bomb. Can pair with Incendiary Bomb. Might be useful sometimes.
    *   **Scorching Fire:** Increases ATK by 100%. Cost: 250. Used against medium units (Sledgehammers, Steel Balls). Sometimes needed vs leveled Crawlers. Good vs armor tech. Can even kill giants if leveled enough.
    *   **Incendiary Bomb:** Launches barrage of Incendiary Bombs every 16s (180m max, 40m min range) to ignite ground. Cost: 300. **Very powerful technology** if enemy is overcommitted to ground. Pair with EMP barrage Melters to force fire through. Enemy can force first wave into flank by deploying Crawlers.
    *   **Best Partner:** Summon 1 Marksman (same level) at combat start. Cost: 200. **Very good vs Wraith pushes** and other pushes. Good with senior manufacturing specialist (when building ~4 Vulcans makes sense).
    *   **Ignite:** Attacks ignite target (6% HP/sec for 2s). Cost: 200. Only good vs War Factories. Might be the play if it fits style and matches War Factories often.

#### War Factory

*   **Used against:** Arclight, Marksman, Rhino, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Vulcan, Stormcaller, Overlord, Fire Badger, Typhoon, Sabertooth
*   **Countered by:** Melting Point, Scorpion
*   **How to play War Factory:** Best use case is as a **Missile interceptor device**. Very good at this, effect doesn't diminish over time. Use shielded Fangs to bait Stormcaller fire, then follow with Factory to intercept missiles. Also works against Fortress anti-air barrage. Not usually good vs overload Overlords (they overwhelm it). Great choice vs Overlords if AM tech isn't available. Has an **upkeep of 200/round**, a late game unit (not before round 5). Early deploy vulnerable to flanks and loses economy. Proactive play with summoning techs requires setup and is easily countered due to economy loss. Spawned units are same level as Factory. Cannot equip items.
*   **Mechabellum War Factory counter:** **Best counter is usually a Scorpion** with range/siege mode and acid. Second best is a Melting Point. Leveled, aggressively deployed Steel Balls are sufficient if committed to harder. Vulcans with Ignite are viable. Fortresses with Fang Summon + Ignite on Fangs works. If enemy runs missile interceptor, avoid committing hard to Overlords or Stormcallers.
*   **War Factory Builds:** Some highlighted War Factory builds are listed. Surrey's War Factory build is mentioned. Thinks it's best used as strong anti-missile device. After committing, keep safe and deal damage with Range tech. Phoenix Summoning if lacking anti-air. Going fully into summoning techs hasn't been great recently.
*   **War Factory Technologies:**
    *   **Efficient Maintenance:** Upkeep cost -100. Cost: 50. Problem: increases cost of other techs by 200. Usually too late to give value (like picking top supply specialist round 7). Gives leeway on when you can commit. Questionable if such a strategy is good.
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +5m for main guns, ATK -40%. Cost: 150. Niche use to counter Rhino/Crawler all-ins, but Wraith is a better tool.
    *   **Sledgehammer Production:** Produces 1 Sledgehammer every 4.4s. Cost: 250. Good choice: speed similar to Factory, join as group, protect each other. Usually the best summoning tech (summons more, costs less). Good vs Melting Points.
    *   **Steel Ball Production:** Produces 1 Steel Ball every 5.5s. Cost: 300. Great chaff generation tool, especially with Mechanical Division tech on Steel Balls. Vs Acid: Mech div Steel Ball summoning or Range.
    *   **Phoenix Production:** Produces 1 Phoenix every 11s. Cost: 350. Only anti-air unit Factory can spawn, valuable since Factory doesn't hit air.
    *   **Photon Coating:** 30% damage reduction for first 25s, immunity to electromagnetic, ignition, acid effects. Cost: 200. Not good vs acid etc.. Best used as a one-round trick to deploy on the line to tank max damage, but usually not a good idea.
    *   **Launcher Overload:** Attack interval -50%, range -20m. Cost: 200. Usually cannot go Launcher Overload without Range first. Best in War Factory mirrors. Good vs Fortresses.
    *   **Missile Intercept:** Tries to intercept missiles within 150m. Efficiency declines, independent of level/attack. Cost: 200. **Very powerful technology**. Usually the reason to build a War Factory. Matches ~4-6 anti-missile devices, interrupts steadily. Can interrupt Rocket Punch Fortresses and 2 EMP barrages from Melting Points simultaneously. Good vs teched & leveled Stormcallers. Not good vs Launcher Overload Overlords.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Makes Factory invincible to small units (already is). Melting point and acid are the threats.
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Keeps Factory safe after enemy counters it. Good vs acid and Melting Points.

#### Wasp

*   **Used against:** Marksman, Phoenix, Melting Point, Vulcan, Overlord
*   **Countered by:** Mustang, Fortress, Fang, Wraith, Typhoon, Tarantula
*   **How to play Wasp:** Can be played many ways depending on board/techs. Early game: **harassment unit with Jump Drive and Mobile Beacon** (effective vs defensive holes). Later: add Rhinos/Steel Balls frontline to push, or switch to defensive, Jump Drive back, tech shields (meat shields). Can be main damage dealer (insane damage with ground/air specializations) but very squishy, needs solid frontline. Key for damage: early levels + items; Late game: Elite Marksmen/Range to stay safe. Most often used as **meat shields**. Good vs leveled Marksmen and Melting Points. Trick: block sentry missiles (tank with Wasps, splash hits only air units).
*   **Mechabellum Wasp counter:** Early game: buy **Mustangs** when Wasps appear. Wraiths can be good if enemy pairs Wasps with lots of Crawlers. Rare Typhoons can also counter. Mid/Late game: **Fortresses with Anti-air barrage are the best option**. Forts counter Wasps + paired mobile frontline (Steel Ball). Countering Forts with Wasps often requires countering the counters (Aerial spec Marksmen, charged shot Phoenix, Melting Point vs Field Maintenance Wraiths). Countering own Wasps with Aerial spec + Range can be good. If enemy uses Wasps as chaff vs Phoenix/Marksmen and you have Fangs, tech Fang Range instead of Mustangs.
*   **Wasp Builds:** Some highlighted Wasp builds are listed. Surrey's Wasp build is mentioned. Uses early with Jump Drive/beacons, only techs Jump Drive. Sells or techs Elite Marksman if high level. Best role now: **countering enemy Wasps or mass Overlord strategies** (Range + Air Spec available). Energy shield Wasps as chaff are overkill (shield useless vs Mustangs etc.).
*   **Wasp Technologies:**
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. Required for carry Wasps. Don't tech too early to avoid revealing commitment.
    *   **Ground Specialization:** ATK +200% to ground units. Cost: 200. 3x damage is "crazy". With Jump Drive, can divert power instantly. Strong as flank defender and pusher (with Steel Ball frontline). Not good late game (Wasps die rapidly).
    *   **Aerial Specialization:** ATK +75% to air, range +30m vs air. Cost: 200. **Cannot commit into Wasps without this**; enemy can counter with their own Wasps. Good vs air units.
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +7m, ATK -40%. Cost: 150. Not bought often, but keeps Wasps versatile. Useful for clearing Crawlers, Fangs, Wasps. Okay vs Mustangs. Better to counter these units with other units.
    *   **Energy Shield:** Energy shield absorbs damage equal to HP, blocks at least one instance. Cost: 300. Very strong on paper. Reality: Wasps die if hit, shield doesn't solve it. Even as chaff, shield doesn't matter much vs Mustangs. Often still +value but costs tech slot. Good against spells (missile strike, orbital, storm) and flank sentry missiles.
    *   **Ignite:** Attacks have chance to ignite (6% HP/sec for 2s). Cost: 200. Powerful effect, but underwhelming on Wasps (amazing on Fangs).
    *   **Jump Drive:** Movement speed +5m/s, free repositioning during deployment. Cost: 50. **Best technology**. Allows movement early/mid game to avoid counters and force suboptimal enemy units. Playstyle dependent. Allows options with Elite specialist and early level 2-3 Wasp drops.
    *   **Armor-Piercing Bullets:** Increases ATK by 50%. Cost: 200. Specialization upgrades are better.
    *   **Elite Marksman:** Range +5m, ATK +25% per level. Cost: 300. Range is the important part. Most relevant in Wasp vs Wasp battles. Otherwise, not that good.

#### Wraith

*   **Used against:** Crawler, Fang, Sledgehammer, Steel Ball, Wasp
*   **Countered by:** Overlord, Phoenix, Melting Point, Marksman
*   **How to play Wraith:** **Best use case is to clear crawlers**. Damage can't be blocked by other units due to multiple targets. Short range, best used as a **very aggressive unit or defender against aggro**. All items are strong (hits multiple targets, doesn't overkill much, high HP pool). Damage items great, health items good. Haste module strong offensively. If using offensively, need the Range technology pretty fast to avoid walking too far forward and dying.
*   **Mechabellum Wraith counter:** Avoid deploying too much aggressive chaff in one place. Sledgehammers are quite good "chaff" against Wraith early (take time to clear, Wraith often paired with Crawlers). (Further counter details found in "Wraith Builds" section). These technologies provide the best kit: slow on enemies, high damage vs small/medium, armor/field maintenance to tank fangs/mustangs. Overlords counter Degenerate Beam.
*   **Wraith Builds:** Some highlighted Wraith builds are listed. Surrey's Wraith build is mentioned. Tech kit is designed vs fast moving stuff. Uses Degenerate Beam later vs too much chaff for Overlords. Floating artillery array only vs mass Wraith (rare). Field maintenance is great vs high leveled Wraith from drops or early Mustangs/Marksmen. Range is usually his first tech if pushing (needed); might not need if defending.
*   **Wraith Technologies:**
    *   **High-Explosive Ammo:** Splash damage range +5m, ATK -40%. Cost: 150. Wraith already strong vs all chaff. Useful vs shielded Fangs, but needs Range upgrade too, making it too expensive.
    *   **Field Maintenance:** HP +30%, restores 4.5% Max HP/sec upon taking damage. Cost: 300. Offers **very good rounds later** due to high level Wraith drops. Solid early vs non-Aerial spec Marksmen and Mustangs.
    *   **Armor Enhancement:** HP +35%, 60 damage blocked + 60/level. Cost: 200. Very cheap. Quite good with mass produced Wraith card. Good vs Mustangs. Field Maintenance generally better (stronger with high level Wraith drops).
    *   **Range Enhancement:** Increases attack range by 40m. Cost: 300. **Quite mandatory**. Almost always the first tech. Allows clearing more chaff faster and protects Wraith by letting it stay back.
    *   **Degenerate Beam:** Projects beam to ground units (120m range). Reduces movement speed by 40%, attack power by 30%, units take +30% damage when attacked. Cost: 200. Effect is "INSANE". Countered by Photon Coating. Usually not plausible for enemy to deploy Overlords everywhere; enemy going Overlords can be beneficial if you have enough chaff.
    *   **Floating Artillery Array:** Movement speed -3, floating cannons increases from 4 to 8. Cost: 400. A bit expensive. Doubles damage output. Better than +100% damage as it stacks with items and has multiple targets. Worthwhile with multiple Wraiths. Allows heavy commitment without higher damage units (Overlords, Melting Points). Niche use case but serves purpose.
